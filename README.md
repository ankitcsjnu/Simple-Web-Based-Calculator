-------------------------------------Simple-Web-Based-Calculator---------------------------------------

The main goal of this project is to create a simple and interactive calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project helps me learn how to design a user interface using HTML and CSS, and how to add logic using JavaScript.

------------------Features of My Calculator:-------------------

1. User-friendly interface.
2.Buttons for numbers (0-9) and operations (+, –, ×, ÷).
3.Clear button to reset the input.
4.Real-time calculation display.
5.Responsive layout (works well on laptop or desktop).

What I Learned while making this project:---

HTML: How to create buttons, input fields, and use div elements for layout.
CSS: How to design using colors, padding, margins, font styles, and layout positioning like flexbox.
JavaScript: How to write functions, handle button clicks, perform math operations, and show results on the screen.

------------------------------Conclusion:---------------------

This calculator project helped me understand the basics of web development. It was a fun and educational experience where I combined HTML (structure), CSS (design), and JavaScript (functionality) to build a real, working web application. It is my first step toward learning full-stack web development.
